Gert Expectation/Concern

Team should independenly work without Edwin help as Edwin leaving this prject from july 1st.
Concern on Ranjan as he does not have enough skill to work.

==========
Discussed with team identified  few  gaps in application functional knowledge & Technical knowledge.

Every monday knowledge sharing session 

Edwin sharing the functional knowledge based on teh user story team is working on it.

Team is really progressing well but still there are some issue that  we need to discuss it.

Ranjan, 
    
    He  does not have java and any other framework skill.
    He completely depends on  Edwin & Team
    he does t have  programing & debuging skill.
    He does not have agile knwledge.
    he join the project more than 5 months but he did a local setup two weeks  back with team's help 
    He is  not progressing and he is spiling team's  time.

Overall  he is not fix this project atleast ..  so we need a replacement. so taht slowly we  can replace him.
